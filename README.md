# EFK_SLAM
Simultaneous localization and mapping using the Extended Kalman Filter. This project was for a graduate robotics & vision course in Mechanical Engineering. Check out the pdf for thoery and details. The math and logic is sound, but I only wrote short scientific computing scripts before this project so the code is ugly =D. I will hopefully go back and clean it up some day.
