# EFK_SLAM
Simultaneous localization and mapping using the Extended Kalman Filter. This project was for a graduate robotics & vision course in Mechanical Engineering. Check out the pdf for thoery and details. The math and logic is sound, but the code is ugly (I only wrote short scientific computing scripts before this project). I will hopefully go back and clean it up some day.
